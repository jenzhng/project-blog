I am excited to start working on the Escape Room Project for Online Capstone Summer Term 2024. Even though the course is just 8 weeks, I am confident we will be able to make a great project together. The languages I am most comfortable about are Python and C/C++. I was most excited about the 3D Escape Room Challenge and the Firefighter Simulator. Specifically, the Escape Room Project would allow our team to work on a physics-based puzzle, which would be exciting. 

## Project Considerations

For this project, our group will likely use Unity as it can be more accessible through the OSU software portal. We will look for available assets and shaders we can use for this project. For the members of our team, this will be our first time working on building a game, so following tutorials (guided learning) would be the best while working on game development. 

## References

For references for the structure of this project, I came across a blog post <a href="https://dev.to/sebight/creating-an-escape-room-game-in-unity-1i9f">Creating an Escape Room</a>
 for considering the basics of a Unity-based escape room game. Some things to consider are the need for an Inventory UI and different controller scripts for the Player/Camera.
