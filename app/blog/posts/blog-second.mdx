Over the course of the Escape Room 3D Challenge Project, I was able to learn in-depth about game development. I will talk about the challenges our team faced while developing the project and some features we were able to implement. 

## Physics-Based Puzzle

One of the puzzles implemented for the project was a physics-based puzzle. The player can interact with the puzzle by click-and-drag or by using I-K-J-L keys on their keyboard. There is a rigidbody component added to the ball in the maze that enables the ball to roll around the maze. Setting the mass to 10 gives the ball the momentum of a billiard ball. Below is an image example of the puzzle.

## Simple HUD and UI System

Another aspect of the game is a interaction system that allows the player to see the name of an object they see through an on-screen pop-up window. The player can also see an extra description that shows more information about the object. There is also an optional hint system that the player can enable by pressing 'H' key.

## Enhanced Readability and Maintainability

## Inspect System

Below is a snippet of code that implements the inspect object system in the project. This enables the player to inspect objects to get hints on how to proceed onto the next stage of the game.

```csharp
public class ObjectController : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private string itemName;
    [TextArea] [SerializeField] private string itemExtraInfo;

    [TextArea] [SerializeField] private string hintText;

    [SerializeField] private InspectController inspectController;

    private bool isInteracting = false;  // Track interaction state
    // Show object name
    public void ShowObjectName()
    {
        inspectController.ShowName(itemName);
        isInteracting = true;
    }
    // Hide object name
    public void HideObjectName()
    {
        inspectController.HideName();
        isInteracting = false;
    }
    // Show additional information
    public void ShowExtraInfo()
    {
        inspectController.ShowAdditionalInfo(itemExtraInfo);
    }
    // Press 'H' to show the hint when inspecting item
    public void ShowHint()
    {
        if (isInteracting)
        {
            inspectController.ShowHint(hintText);
        }
    }
    // Press 'H' to hide the hint when inspecting item
    public void HideHint()
    {
        if (isInteracting)
        {
            inspectController.HideHint();
        }
    }
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

For future considerations of the project, we will work on optimizing the game by minimizing textures and fixing any errors such as overlapping models. To make the game able to play on more platforms, we would have to optimize the Unity build for WebGL. For an executable Windows file, we would have to work on other considerations for the project. 

## Conclusion

Over the course of this project, our team was able to learn valuable skills such as team collaboration and version control on GitHub. We were able to figure our way around Unity 3D Game Engine and its many tools and services such as Animator, 2D Sprite Editor and its Scripting API. By working on this project, I have a newfound appreciation for game development and this project has given me encouragement to continue and create more simple web games.
