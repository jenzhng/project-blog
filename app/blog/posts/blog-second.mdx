## Improved Code Quality and Safety

One of the most compelling reasons to use static typing is the improvement it brings to code quality and safety. By enforcing type checks at compile time, static typing catches errors early in the development process, reducing the chances of runtime errors.



## Enhanced Readability and Maintainability

## Facilitates Tooling and Refactoring

```csharp

```

## Performance Optimizations

For future considerations of the project, we will work on optimizing the game by minimizing textures and fixing any errors such as overlapping models. To make the game able to play on more platforms, we would have to optimize the Unity build for WebGL. For an executable Windows file, we would have to work on other considerations for the project. 

## Conclusion

Over the course of this project, our team was able to learn valuable skills such as team collaboration and version control on GitHub. We were able to figure our way around Unity 3D Game Engine and its many tools and services such as Animator, 2D Sprite Editor and its Scripting API.
