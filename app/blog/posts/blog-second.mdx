Over the course of the Escape Room 3D Challenge Project, I was able to learn in-depth about game development. I will talk about the challenges our team faced while developing the project and some features we were able to implement. 

## Physics-Based Puzzle

One of the puzzles implemented for the project was a physics-based puzzle. The player can interact with the puzzle by click-and-drag or by using I-K-J-L keys on their keyboard.

## Simple HUD and UI System

## Enhanced Readability and Maintainability

## Inspect System

Below is a snippet of code that implements the inspect object system in the project. This enables the player to inspect objects to get hints on how to proceed onto the next stage of the game.

```csharp
public class ObjectController : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private string itemName;
    [TextArea] [SerializeField] private string itemExtraInfo;

    [TextArea] [SerializeField] private string hintText;

    [SerializeField] private InspectController inspectController;

    private bool isInteracting = false;  // Track interaction state

    public void ShowObjectName()
    {
        inspectController.ShowName(itemName);
        isInteracting = true;
    }

    public void HideObjectName()
    {
        inspectController.HideName();
        isInteracting = false;
    }

    public void ShowExtraInfo()
    {
        inspectController.ShowAdditionalInfo(itemExtraInfo);
    }

    public void ShowHint()
    {
        if (isInteracting)
        {
            inspectController.ShowHint(hintText);
        }
    }

    public void HideHint()
    {
        if (isInteracting)
        {
            inspectController.HideHint();
        }
    }
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

For future considerations of the project, we will work on optimizing the game by minimizing textures and fixing any errors such as overlapping models. To make the game able to play on more platforms, we would have to optimize the Unity build for WebGL. For an executable Windows file, we would have to work on other considerations for the project. 

## Conclusion

Over the course of this project, our team was able to learn valuable skills such as team collaboration and version control on GitHub. We were able to figure our way around Unity 3D Game Engine and its many tools and services such as Animator, 2D Sprite Editor and its Scripting API.
